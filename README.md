# TaskMate
TaskMate is a simple, elegant task management app built with React.  
It lets you add, edit, and delete tasks — and customize the look with built-in theme switching.  
Your tasks and selected theme are saved automatically using local storage, so they’re right there when you come back.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`
⚠ **Note:** this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time.  
This command will copy all the configuration files and dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control.
